# Selectors - Recoil

In this code, Recoil is used for state management in a React app. Several pieces of state like jobatom, messagatom, networkatom, and notifiactionatom store individual notification counts. Instead of manually adding these counts to get a total, a selector called totalNotificationSelector is used. A selector in Recoil is like a smart function that automatically calculates and returns a derived valueâ€”in this case, the total number of notifications. It watches the atoms it depends on and updates automatically whenever any of them change. This makes the code cleaner and avoids manual recalculation, similar to how useMemo works, but integrated with Recoil's state system.
